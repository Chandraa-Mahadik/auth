TODO : 
    - To have a config based implementation for each approach of authentication ( reference doc: authentication_practices.txt )

---- 
Objective In Short : 
An OIDC + PKCE IdP has three responsibilities, not just “identify user”
1️⃣ Authenticate the user
“Who is this human?”
Password / MFA / device / risk checks
Creates IdP SSO session cookie
Output: a user identity
2️⃣ Authenticate the client app
“Which app is asking?”
client_id
redirect_uri
PKCE / client_secret
App registration metadata
📌 App identity is first-class, just like user identity.
3️⃣ Issue tokens with claims
“What is this user allowed to do in this app?”
This is where your RBAC/ABAC question fits.

----

TODO : 
Not to introduce these until the app runs clean locally and you’ve hardened refresh logic:
    oauth_clients, authorization_codes, jwks_keys, etc.
    MFA tables
    notification outbox tables
